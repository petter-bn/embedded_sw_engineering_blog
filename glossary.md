| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Binary code | Binary code is binary data files generated by a computer and read by a computer. They can contain executable code or data. | |
| Bucket | A "bucket" is SW, part of the architecture, but (by purpose) not included in a component. Buckets are often needed for the communication between components (for example standard types). | |
| Cohesion | A property of a SW component. A component with high cohesion contains parts which are coupled and serves a common purpose. | |
| Coupling | Two SW components are coupled if there is a dependency from one to another. High coupling implaise amny dependencies and connection, whiole low coupling implies few or none. | |
| Component | A component is a self contained set of source code, with an interface and a purpose. | [Component](component.html)|
| Document | A document is (normally) written by a human, to be read by a human. ||
| Integrity | A property of a SW component. A component with high integrity has low coupling to other components, and fulfills a clear purpose. | | 
| Layer Architecture | A standard architecture where the SW is split into SW layers, where one layer provides services to higher layers, and dependencies goes from higher layers ot lowers. Lower layers are generally more generic than higher layers. | |
| MMI | Man-Machine-Interface | |
| Source Code | Source code is text written by a human and read by a computer. The source code is used by the computer to generate binary code. | |
| Software | Software can be one of: source code, binary code, software configuration items, software update files. | |
