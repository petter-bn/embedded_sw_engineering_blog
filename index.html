        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>
            Components are the foundation of all good software
            engineering. Not only embedded software engineering.
            Components have an inside and an outside. If you work 
            outside the component, you only need to know what the
            component does. Not how it does it. For someone to
            know this the component need to have a "contract".

        <h2>Component Design and Coding</h2>
        <p>
            The fundamental skill for a SW developer is to be able to
            design and implement a software component. When the contract 
            is specified you need to design the component and 
            write code that implements the contract.

        <h2>Component Verification</h2>
        <p>
            Component verification is the process of making sure a
            component fulfills the contract. There are many ways to do this
            and the methods are often combined to achive the quality needed
            by the project.

        <h2>Embedded Software Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The software architecture decides which components a SW
            contains, and how the components interacts. The SW architecture
            decides on how common architectural patterns are used, how 
            software is reused, and designs for aspects like safety, security,
            reliability, availability, compatibility and performance. The
            software architecture also designs how several product variants
            can be produced from one source system and how software is 
            commissioned and deployed.
