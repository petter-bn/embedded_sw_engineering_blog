            <h2>Components</h2>
            <p>
                Components are the foundation of all good software
                engineering. Not only embedded software engineering.
                Components have an inside and an outside. If you work 
                outside the component, you only need to know what the
                component does. Not how it does it. For someone to
                know this the component need to have a "contract".

            <h2>Component Design and Coding</h2>
            <p>
                The fundamental skill for a SW developer is to be able to
                design and implement a software component. When the contract 
                is specified you need to design the component and 
                write code that implements the contract. 
            </p>            
        </div>
        <div class="esechapter green">
            <h2>Component Verification</h2>
            <p>
                Component verification is the process of making sure a
                component fulfills the contract. There are many ways to do this
                and the methods are often combined to achive the quality needed
                by the project.

            <h2>Embedded Software Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                The SW requirements defines a SW. They form the contract 
                of what the "user" of the SW can expect, and what the 
                developer of the SW tries to implement. It is the input 
                for development, testing and integration.

        <div class="esechapter green">
            <h2>Embedded Software Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                The software architecture decides which components a SW
                contains, and how the components interacts. Embedded 
                software architecture also defines how the SW is deployed
                and interacts with the electronics of the product.

            <h2>Embedded Software Integration and Verification</h2>
            <p>
                Software integration and verification is the process of
                configuring and combining SW components and testing 
                larger and larger parts of the SW. This process also
                involves configuration of software.

            <h2>Build</h2>
            <p>
                Build is the process of configuring, compiling and
                linking  source  code to executables. And to package
                these executables into deployable SW packages.

            <h2>Version Control</h2>
            <p>
                Version control is the discipline of maintaining several
                versions of the same SW, to be able to trace all 
                executables back to the corresponding source code, and to
                be able to maintain different development branches.

            <h2>Continous Integration and Verification</h2>
            <p>
                Continous integration and verification is the process of 
                frequently repeated automatic SW integration and testing.
                This can be combined with automatic gating of SW with
                unacceptable quality.

            <h2>Variation</h2>
            <p>
               Variation handling is to generate several different 
               product variants from one source system.

            <h2>Configuration Management</h2>
            <p>
                Configuration management is the activity of keeping track
                of the versions of the "configuration items" (for example source code
                , documents and binary files) and how they relate.

            <h2>Release</h2>
            <p>
                The release process makes sure that software is released
                from the project, to be used outside the project, in a 
                way that the quality of the released SW is known, and the purpose
                of the release is clear.

            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                Deployment is the process of delivering and loading the SW
                and needed data onto a target system, either in mass production,
                as a SW update or for prototyping purpose.

            <h2>Industrialization</h2>
            <p>
                Industrialization of embedded SW, is to make sure the SW
                is suited for massproduction, distribution and use by end users.
                It includes activities as end-user documentation, functions
                for end-of-line test and calibration and functions for online
                and offline diagnostics. Here I also include internationalization.

            <p>
                In larger project progress and quality measurements needs 
                to be quantified. We need tools for tracking the number of 
                requirements approved and implemented. We nned to track the
                number of failed test cases and test the test coverage. 
                We need to measure the technical debt.
