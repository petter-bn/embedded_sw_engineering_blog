<h1> Software Components </h1>

The source code is the fundament of all 
SW engineering.* So why don't I start with writing about source code
instead of components? This is a good question. However, so many good
coding practices are best understood in the context of components. Doing
good unit testing, defensive programming or concurrent programming is
harder (and ma


ybe futile) if you don't have a component structure.



	<div class="footnote">
	* You could argue that the binary executable code is the fundament of all SW
	engineering, as this is the code that is actually executed and provides 
	the value for the user. But in practice the binary is predictably and
  repeatably generated from the source code. And the binary is seldom
  something a SW engineer directly works with. In fact, if you need to
  work manually with the binary, or it is not directly and predictably
  derived from the source code, then your project has problems.
