<h1> Software Components </h1>

<p>
The source code is the fundament of all 
SW engineering.* So why don't I start with writing about source code
instead of components? This is a good question. However, so many good
coding practices are best understood in the context of components. Doing
good unit testing, defensive programming or concurrent programming is
harder (and maybe futile) if you don't have a component structure.

The component is
an encapsulation of source code, and has an interface. There is an inside and an outside.
The component has a purpose. From the outside, the

All (almost) source code in your SW system should belong to a component.

  repeatably generated from the source code. And the binary is seldom
  something a SW engineer directly works with. In fact, if you need to
  work manually with the binary, or it is not directly and predictably
  derived from the source code, then your project has problems.
