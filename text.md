The source code is the fundament of all 
SW engineering.* So why don't I start with writing about source code
instead of components? This is a good question. However, so many good
coding practices are best understood in the context of components. Doing
good unit testing, defensive programming or concurrent programming is
harder (and maybe futile) if you don't have a component structure.
